当处理器只有一个，而在内存中存在多个程序/任务/进程的时候，它们就会共享处理器资源。而操作系统就要负责让它们能够高效合理地共享处理器资源，这就引入了调度（scheduling）这个概念。进程调度就是操作系统进程管理的重要组成部分。事实上，在计算机出现之前，调度的概念和应用就出现在人类的生活、工作和生产环境中了，如汽车装配线调度、工厂作业车间调度等。调度的一个一般定义是：在一定的约束条件下，把有限的资源在时间上分配给若干个任务，以满足或优化一个或多个性能指标。对于计算机系统而言，就是在一台计算机中的内存中运行了多个进程，操作系统把有限的处理器在时间上分配给各个进程，以满足或优化进程执行的性能指标。 在rCore-Tutorial中，给每个任务分配了时间片，任务执行消耗完时间片后，操作系统就可以抢占正在执行的任务，把处理器分配给其他任务执行。这就是一种基于时间片的轮转调度策略。再之后实现的操作系统都采用了这种调度策略。 接下来要做的便是按照更多的调度算法原理，为rCore-Tutorial实现各种进程调度机制，来提高系统的调度能力。","breadcrumbs":"进程调度 »

Share，又称为 比例份额，Proportional Share）调度。其基本思路是基于每个进程的重要性（即优先级）的比例关系，分配给该进程同比例的处理器执行时间。 彩票调度(Lottery) 一种有意思的FSS调度是彩票调度（Lottery Scheduling），它是从经济学的的彩票行为中吸取营养，模拟了购买彩票和中奖的随机性，给每个进程发彩票，进程优先级越高，所得到的彩票就越多；然后每隔一段时间（如，一个时间片），举行一次彩票抽奖，抽出来的号属于哪个进程，哪个进程就能运行。 其具体实现过程是，在每个时间片到时，操作系统就抽取彩票，由于操作系统已知总彩票数有10张，所以操作系统产生一个从0和9之间随机数作为获奖彩票号，拥有这个彩票号的进程中奖，并获得下一次处理器执行机会。通过在一段较长的时间内不断地抽彩票，基于统计学，可以保证两个两个进程可以获得与优先级等比例的处理器执行时间。 步长调度(Stride) 另一种FSS调度为Stride调度。其基本思路是：每个进程有一个步长（Stride）属性值，这个值与进程优先级成反比，操作系统会定期记录每个进程的总步长，即行程（pass），并选择拥有最小行程值的进程运行。 具体实现可以像这样： 为每个进程设置一个当前 stride，表示该进程当前已经运行的“长度”。另外设置其对应的 pass 值（只与进程的优先权有关系），表示对应进程在调度后，stride 需要进行的累加值。 每次需要调度时，从当前 runnable 态的进程中选择 stride 最小的进程调度。对于获得调度的进程 P，将对应的 stride 加上其对应的步长 pass。 一个时间片后，回到上一步骤，重新调度当前 stride 最小的进程。","breadcrumbs":"通用计算机系统的调度 »

实时的任务是由一组进程来实现，其中每个进程的行为是可预测和提前确定的。这些进程称为实时进程，它们的执行时间一般较短。支持实时任务的操作系统称为实时操作系统。实时计算机系统是一种以确定的时间范围起到主导作用的计算机系统，一旦外设发给计算机一个事件（如时钟中断、网络包到达等），计算机必须在一个确定时间范围内做出响应。","breadcrumbs":"实时计算机系统的调度 »

这种策略背后的理由是：更频繁地需要 CPU 的任务应分配更高的优先级。此外，单调速率调度假定：对于每次 CPU 执行，周期性进程的处理时间是相同的。也就是说，在每次进程获取 CPU 时，它的 CPU 执行长度是相同的。","breadcrumbs":"实时计算机系统的调度 »

first-out，先进先出）调度策略的基本思路就是按进程请求处理器的先后顺序来使用处理器。在具体实现上，操作系统建立一个就绪队列，当一个应用进入被加载，并创建为进程进入就绪态后，就按先后顺序放入就绪队列尾；操作系统从就绪队列头取出进程来执行。操作系统不会主动打断进程的运行。当正在运行的进程主动放弃处理器，操作系统会把该进程放到就绪队列末尾，并从就绪队列头取出新进程执行；当正在运行的进程阻塞时，操作系统会把该进程放到阻塞队列中，并从就绪队列头取出新进程执行；当阻塞进程转为就绪进程后，操作系统 会把该进程放到就绪队列末尾。 该调度策略的优点是简单，容易实现。对于满足1~6的约束条件的执行环境，用这个调度策略的平均周转时间性能指标也很好。如果在一个在较长的时间段内，每个进程都能结束，那么公平性这个性能指标也是能得到保证的。 FCFS 策略的缺点是，短进程可被排在长进程后面，平均等待时间往往很长。","breadcrumbs":"批处理系统与交互式系统的调度 »

CPU。 为了实现 RR 调度，我们再次将就绪队列视为进程的 FIFO 队列。新进程添加到就绪队列的尾部。CPU 调度程序从就绪队列中选择第一个进程，将定时器设置在一个时间片后中断，最后分派这个进程。 现有的rCore-Tutorial便是按照这个逻辑在FCFS的基础上添加timer定时器，实现了RR调度。","breadcrumbs":"批处理系统与交互式系统的调度 »

CPU 执行长度的近似值，可以选择具有预测最短 CPU 执行的进程来运行。 要为rCore-Tutorial实现，我采用第一种方法，让用户在提交可执行文件时对其执行时间进行标注，内核在初始化进程时，按照标注的大小，对进程就绪队列进行排序，这样每次取出执行的进程便是最短作业。","breadcrumbs":"批处理系统与交互式系统的调度 »

相反，多级反馈队列调度算法允许进程在队列之间迁移。这种想法是，根据不同 CPU 执行的特点来区分进程。如果进程使用过多的 CPU 时间，那么它会被移到更低的优先级队列。这种方案将 I/O 密集型和交互进程放在更高优先级队列上。由此确定的多级反馈队列调度则按照如下条件执行： 创建进程并让进程首次进入就绪队列时，设置进程的优先级为最高优先级。 进程用完其时间配额后，就会降低其优先级。
